She begins by stating the man’s opinion: he is opposed to the decision to purchase a new sound system for the auditorium. Then, in her own words, she accurately explains his two reasons: first, he feels the auditorium is so old that the new sound system won’t result in an improvement, and second, he thinks that the survey results are questionable because the students may have answered as they did only because for students there are not many activities on campus other than going to the movies.
