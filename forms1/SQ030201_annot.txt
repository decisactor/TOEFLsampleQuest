This response meets the criteria at score level 4.
This response is sustained, coherent, and well developed. The speaker states his preference for cafés and begins his explanation by saying why he doesn’t meet his friends at home: his apartment is too small and there is almost nothing to do there. He then explains why cafés are better for him: the atmosphere is good, often there is music, and he can meet people there—often, people he does not know. At the end of his response, the speaker goes back to talking about his apartment, and when he does so, he does not just repeat what he has already said but instead elaborates on it. The language he uses is direct and simple, and he chooses his words accurately. The flow of speech is very good, and the speaker is very easy to understand.
