This response meets the criteria at score level 3.
The speaker states the man’s problem and efficiently summarizes the two proposed solutions. She recommends one of the solutions—forming a study group—and adequately explains the reasons for her preference in terms of the advantages of study groups: namely, that they are free and also helpful, since students in the group can talk about the content of the class among themselves and explain the lecture material to each other. What mainly prevents this response from being scored at the highest level is the speaker’s imprecise use of language. For instance, the idea expressed in a sentence like “Study group does not need money but still get help” could be formulated much more accurately and effectively. The speaker could have said, for example, “A study group can be helpful, and students don’t need money to form one,” or “Students can get help from a study group without spending money.” Nevertheless, in spite of inefficiencies like this in the speaker’s use of language, she is generally easy to understand and communicates relevant information in a reasonably clear and coherent way.
