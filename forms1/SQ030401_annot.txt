This response meets the criteria at score level 3.
In this response, the speaker demonstrates quite good use of vocabulary and grammar. His speech is generally very clear, he has good pronunciation, and he uses intonation effectively. The pacing of speech is often very good as well, although at times the speech is rather choppy and marked by frequent hesitations. The speaker gives an accurate summary of the example the professor discusses, but he does not address the concept of flow in general terms or discuss the main features of the phenomenon—that is, total focus on a task, losing track of time, a feeling of satisfaction, and/or completing a task for its own sake rather than for a reward. For this reason, the speaker’s response—in spite of containing a good summary of the example—does not completely fulfill the task, which is not just to describe the example but, rather, to explain how the example illustrates the concept.
